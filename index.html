                        <h3>Personal</h3>
                        <p>Hello! I'm Cin Sang and I am a first-generation second year at Western Kentucky University.
                            I am currently majoring in Computer Science and taking my certificate for Data Analytics.
                            I am originally from Myanmar, Asia, but came to the United States in pursuit of more opportunities, 
                            higher education, and a better quality of life. Without the help and support of friends, family--especailly the blood-related ones--and
                            our community, it would not be possible to be here today as I am. In my free time, I enjoy
                            watching tv series, both animated and live action, reading light novels, and playing mobile legends with my friends.
                            In my other free time, I like to go outside and play soccer or pool with my friends, go on small hiking trips, and 
                            eat out together.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Education</h3>
                        <p>I am currently studying Computer Science at Western Kuntucky University and on track to graduate in 2027.
                            At Western Kentucky University, I am also part of a community called Mahurin Honors College. 
                            I went to high school at Bowling Green High School and graduated with my high school diploma in 2023.
                             I went to Moss Middle School when I was in middle school and I had a robotics class there. I took part of
                              building the robot, programming it to perfrom simple tasks, and going to a competition with my fellow friends and classmates.
                              I took a lot of courses like: <br>
                              Introduction to Web Programming<br>
                              Honors Computer Organization and Architecture<br>
                              Discrete Structures<br>
                              Database Management System I<br>
                              Calculus I <br>
                              Honors Psychology

                            <li>I have also worked at Panda Express as a kitchen helper, but only for about half a year. This job had more reponsibilities and physically more demanding with long hours but it was still fun to learn how to cook with a wok.</li>
